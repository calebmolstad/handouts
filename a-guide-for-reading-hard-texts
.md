A Guide for Reading Hard Texts

-   Make Connections Outside the Text/Build Bridges

    -   Personal Experience
    -   Current Events

Creating analogies (mental bridges) with things you know can help you
grasp difficult or confusing ideas.

-   Read with a Pencil or Highlighter

    -   Underline/Highlight important sentences
    -   Write notes and summaries of sections in the margins

-   Look for pointing words to give you clues as to what the author is
    doing

    -   Cardinal Numbers: First, Second, Third, Fourth

Authors use these when making a series of points. If you see the word
first, be on the lookout for a second or third point. If you see the
word second and haven’t seen a first, go back over the text, you might
have missed a point.

-   -   Ordinal Numbers: Two, Three, Fourth

This is a clue that the author is about to make a list of something.
Watch for the number of items indicated by the author.

-   -   Value: Important, Significant, Critical, Vital, Most, Major,
        Fundmental

        Here the author is saying something that she considers
        important. Pay attention and underline/highlight sentences in
        which these words occur.

    -   Relationship Words

        -   Time: Next, Then, First, Lastly, Finally, In conclusion

            These words are similar to cardinal numbers. The author is
            working through a outline of things she wants to say. The
            major difference is that these words emphasize a progression
            of ideas. Ideas are building on one another, step by step,
            until they reach an end point. If you are confused, go back
            to where the argument started. You may have missed a step.

        -   Cause: Therefore, For that reason, Consequently

            These words indicate that what the author is about to say is
            dependent on what has just been said.

        -   Turning-Point: However, Although, But, On the contrary,
            Difference

            These words warn you about a turn in the argument. If you
            miss this, you may get the impression that an author agrees
            with something he said when he really disagrees with it.
            Knowing what the author disagree with is as important as
            knowing what he agrees with.

    -   Examples: Example, Illustrate, These demonstrate/show

        Here the author is about to or has just given examples of the
        concept she is describing. If you are confused as to what is
        being talked about, a concrete example might allow you to make a
        connection to something you are already familiar with.

    -   Look for places where the author tells you what he is going to
        say

-   Define Unknown Words

    -   Sound it out-Sometimes your ears recognize what your eyes don’t
    -   Break words into pieces-Look for familiar prefixes, suffixes,
        and roots

        “Regeneration”—Re- is the same prefix in repeat and rewind which
        both have to do with doing something again or going back.
        Generation is like a generator, which makes electricity.
        “Regeneration” might have something to do with making
        electricity again.

    -   Look for context

        Context can tell you that regeneration involves the remaking of
        things other than electricity. Likewise, if you know some of the
        words in a list, unknown words on that list probably have a
        similar meaning. For example, “The lights were bright, shining,
        and lambent” or “She ate Wheaties, Cheerios, and Weet-Bix for
        breakfast.”

-   Interrogate the Text

    Like detectives in a procedural drama, asking good questions of a
    text and them using the text to answer them can help you get at what
    it is saying.

    -   Ask open ended questions that don’t have yes or no answers.
    -   Like a good detective, make sure the answers you find are backed
        up by hard evidence. Make a note of these sentences so you can
        bring them up in class to support your conclusion.

-   Create a map/outline of the argument in the text

    Most authors work from some kind of outline. You can use pointing
    words to re-create a rough outline of the text’s main points and
    arguments. This can either be a mental map or something your write
    on a sheet of paper.
