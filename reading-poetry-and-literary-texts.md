Reading Poetry and Literary Texts
=================================

>“You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

>"Frequently."

>"How often?"

>"Well, some hundreds of times."

>"Then how many are there?"

>"How many? I don't know."

>"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed."

>-Sherlock Holmes in *A Scandal in Bohemia*

-   Read with a Pencil or Highlighter

    -   Sentence structure
    -   Patterns

-   Figurative Language

        -   Initial Rhyme
        Note the rhyme scheme. For example aabbcc or ababcdcd

    -   Alliteration-The beginning of words with the same sounds or
        letters
    -   Repeated sounds
    -   Meter
        If your text is a poem, listening to it being read can help
        here.

-   Allusions-References to other texts
    -   Most common references
        -   The Bible
        -   Greek and Roman Mythology
        -   Shakespeare
        You may need to find an annotated version of a text to catch all these.

-   Tone
    -   Happy or sad
    -   Upbeat or depressed
    -   Loving or angry
    -   Hopeful or despairing

    Aim for a word that best matches the tone

-   Define Unknown Words
    -   Sound it out-Sometimes your ears recognize what your eyes don’t
    -   Break words into pieces-Look for familiar prefixes, suffixes,
        and roots

        “Regeneration”—Re- is the same prefix in repeat and rewind which both have to do with doing something again or going back. Generation is like a generator, which makes electricity.
        “Regeneration” might have something to do with making
        electricity again.
    -   Look for context

        Context may tell you that regeneration involves the remaking of things other than electricity. Likewise, if you know some of the words in a list, unknown words on that list probably have a similar meaning. For example, “The lights were bright, shining, and lambent” or “She ate Wheaties, Cheerios, and Weet-Bix for  breakfast.”
    -   Dictionary-On phones everywhere


-   Relationship of the author to the person telling the story
    Often an author will take on a persona to tell a story, especially
    when the story is in the first person. Is the narrator the same as
    the author or someone different?

Interpret
---------
  Interpretation is the act of discovering meaning in a text. Put
  another way, every text is an act of expression. In interpretation, we try to discover what the text is expressing. Interpretation can be a heady subject. The good news is that in basic English classes, most instructors won’t expect you to do a post-modern interpretation or have an opinion on the “death of the author.” Simply trying to find what a text is saying and being able to root it in specific observations in the text is enough.

-   Make Connections Outside the Text/Build Bridges
    -   Personal Experience
    -   Current Events

    Creating analogies (mental bridges) with things you know can help you grasp difficult or confusing ideas.

-   Interrogate the Text
    Like detectives in a procedural drama, asking good questions of a
    text and then using the text to answer them can help you get at what it is saying.

    -   Ask open ended questions that don’t have yes or no answers.
    -   Why questions about the things your observed can be particularly helpful.

        Asking the literary equivalent of “Why did the butler use
        gardening shears to murder Mr. Body when he had poison at his
        disposal?” can help you get at meaning in a complex piece of
        literature.

    -   Like a good detective, make sure the answers you find are backed
        up by hard evidence.
    -   Make a note of these sentences so you can bring them up in class
        to support your conclusion.
    -   Be on the look out for contradiction and inconsistency in the
        text’s “story”
        -   Do the words of characters match their actions?
        -   Does the stated meaning match what is implied or unstated?

-   Look at the Context
    -   Are there literary trends that the author is a part of?
    -   Are there world events that are influencing the author’s subject matter?
