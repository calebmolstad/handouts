College Writing Handouts
=======================

I've spent much looking for material to adapt into handouts for my college level English class, only to run into copyright concerns. Adapting material to fit the needs of your class is an important part of teaching, but one that is difficult when that adaptation and mixing is prohibited by copyright. I've often created my own material and am not very propriety about it. This repository is an experiment in sharing this material in an open and platform agnostic manner.
