Logical Fallacies
=================

Slippery Slope/Camel’s Nose: If x is done, it will set of a chain of
events leading to a terrible result

*If that man becomes president, democracy as we know it will be
destroyed.*

**Ad Hominem/Personal Attack:** Attacking a person rather than her or
his argument

*My opponent is a nasty woman, so you shouldn’t trust her.*

Bandwagon: “Because everybody’s doing it”

*Nine out of ten people drink Bubbly Cola, so you should too.*

**Begging the Question/Circular Reasoning:** Where the argument’s conclusion
is also used as a premise

Everyone should have basic human rights, because human rights are
fundamental to all people.

*I’ve never heard reliable proof that dragons exist. Because dragons
don’t exist, all stories about them are unreliable. I’ve never heard
reliable proof that dragons exist.*

Ozymandias is the wisest man in the world. I know this because it says
so in a book he wrote. The book must be correct because Ozymandias is
the wisest man in the world.

**Straw Man:** Attacking a weakened version of your opponent’s point of view

*Liberals want to take away everyone’s guns and that goes against the
constitution.*

*Conservatives’ obsession with guns shows that they don’t care about
human life.*

**Texas Sharpshooter:** Cherry picking data that supports your conclusions

A man shoots at a barn. When he is done, he paints a target when the
most bullet holes are and claims that he was aiming at that point all
along.

False Moral Equivalence: Making moral comparisons that are not accurate

*That guy is just like Hitler.*

**False Cause:** Correlation doesn't imply causation

*The number of rhinoceroses in the world have been declining at the same
time as the number of bicycles have been increasing. Therefore, bicycles
are causing rhinoceroses to decline.*

Fallacy Fallacy: Arguing that someone’s argument is wrong because he or
she used a logical fallacy or supported it poorly. They may just be bad
at arguing.

*You used a slippery slope argument, therefore you argument is wrong.*

Two Basic Types of Reasoning
===========================

**Deductive Logic:** “reasoning from generals to particulars”-Oxford
English Dictionary (OED)

Example: Syllogisms

>Major Premise: All men are mortal.
>
>Minor Premise: Socrates is a man.
>
>Conclusion: Therefore Socrates is mortal.

**Inductive Logic:** “reasoning from particular facts to
general principles”-OED

Example: “Every raven in a random sample of 3200 ravens is black. This
strongly supports the hypothesis that all ravens are black.”-Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy
